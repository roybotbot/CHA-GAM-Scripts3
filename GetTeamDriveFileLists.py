# Purpose: Get file lists for Team Drives
# Note: This script can use GAM7 or Advanced GAM:
#       https://github.com/GAM-team/GAM

# Customize: DOMAIN_LIST
# Python: Use python or python3 below as appropriate to your system; verify that you have version 3
#  $ python -V   or   python3 -V
#  Python 3.x.y
# Usage:
# 1: If you want to include all Team Drives, do this step and then skip to step 4, otherwise start at step 2.
#  $ gam redirect csv ./TeamDrives.csv print teamdrives fields id,name
# 2: If you want Team Drives for a specific set of organizers, replace <UserTypeEntity> with your user selection in the command below
#  $ gam redirect csv ./AllTeamDrives.csv <UserTypeEntity> print teamdrives role organizer fields id,name
# 3: Delete duplicate Team Drives (some may have multiple organizers). Make sure that ID_FIELD = 'id' in DeleteDuplicateRows.py
#  $ python3 DeleteDuplicateRows.py ./AllTeamDrives.csv ./TeamDrives.csv
# 4: Customize GetTeamDriveOrganizers.py for this task:
#    Set DOMAIN_LIST as required
#    Set ONE_ORGANIZER = True
#    Set SHOW_GROUP_ORGANIZERS = False
#    Set SHOW_USER_ORGANIZERS = True
# 5: Get ACLs for all Team Drives
#  $ gam redirect csv ./TeamDriveACLs.csv multiprocess csv ./TeamDrives.csv gam print drivefileacls "~id" fields emailaddress,role,type
# 6: From that list of ACLs, output a CSV file with headers "id,name,organizer"
#    that shows an organizer/fileOrganizer for each Team Drive
#  $ python3 GetTeamDriveOrganizers.py TeamDriveACLs.csv TeamDrives.csv TeamDriveOrganizers.csv
# 7: From that list of organizers, get the file lists for all Team Drives that have an organizer (matchfield organizer "^.+$")
#    Add additional arguments to the following command to specify desired fields/options; e.g.,
#    fields id,name,driveid,mimetype,size filepath
#  $ gam config csv_input_row_filter "organizers:regex:^.+$" redirect csv ./TeamDriveFileLists.csv multiprocess csv ./TeamDriveOrganizers.csv gam user "~organizers" print filelist select teamdriveid "~id"
# 8: You can identify all Team Drives without an organizer
#  $ gam csv ./TeamDriveOrganizers.csv skipfield organizers "^.+$" gam info teamdrive teamdriveid "~id"
