# Purpose: Show all drive file ACLs for Team Drive files shared outside of a list of specified domains
#          You specify a list of domains, DOMAIN_LIST, and indicate whether this list is exclusive/inclusive
#          EXCLUSIVE_DOMAINS = True: exclude domains in DOMAIN_LIST from the output
#          EXCLUSIVE_DOMAINS = False: include domains in DOMAIN_LIST in the output
#          You can include/exclude shares to anyone in the ouput
#          INCLUDE_ANYONE = True: include shares to anyone in the output
#          INCLUDE_ANYONE = False: exclude shares to anyone from the output
# Note: This script can use GAM7 or Advanced GAM:
#       https://github.com/GAM-team/GAM

# Customize: Set DOMAIN_LIST, EXCLUSIVE_DOMAINS, INCLUDE_ANYONE, NON_INHERITED_ACLS_ONLY
# Python: Use python or python3 below as appropriate to your system; verify that you have version 3
#  $ python -V   or   python3 -V
#  Python 3.x.y
# Usage:
# For all Team Drives, start at step 1; For Team Drives selected by user/group/OU, start at step 7
# All Team Drives
# 1: Get all Team Drives.
#  $ gam redirect csv ./TeamDrives.csv print teamdrives fields id,name
# 2: Get ACLs for all Team Drives
#  $ gam redirect csv ./TeamDriveACLs.csv multiprocess csv ./TeamDrives.csv gam print drivefileacls "~id" fields emailaddress,role,type
# 3: Customize GetTeamDriveOrganizers.py for this task:
#    Set DOMAIN_LIST as required
#    Set INCLUDE_TYPES['user'] = True
#    Set INCLUDE_TYPES['group'] = False
#    Set ONE_ORGANIZER = True
# 4: From that list of ACLs, output a CSV file with headers "id,name,organizers"
#    that shows the organizers for each Team Drive
#  $ python3 GetTeamDriveOrganizers.py TeamDriveACLs.csv TeamDrives.csv TeamDriveOrganizers.csv
# 5: Get ACLs for all team drive files
#  $ gam config csv_input_row_filter "organizers:regex:^.+$" redirect csv ./filelistperms.csv multiprocess csv ./TeamDriveOrganizers.csv gam user "~organizers" print filelist select teamdriveid "~id" fields teamdriveid,id,name,permissions,mimetype
# 6: Go to step 11
# Selected Team Drives
# 7: If you want Team Drives for a specific set of organizers, replace <UserTypeEntity> with your user selection in the command below
#  $ gam redirect csv ./AllTeamDrives.csv <UserTypeEntity> print teamdrives role organizer fields id,name
# 8: Customize DeleteDuplicateRows.py for this task:
#    Set ID_FIELD = 'id'
# 9: Delete duplicate Team Drives (some may have multiple organizers).
#  $ python3 DeleteDuplicateRows.py ./AllTeamDrives.csv ./TeamDrives.csv
# 10: Get ACLs for all team drive files
#  $ gam redirect csv ./filelistperms.csv multiprocess csv ./TeamDrives.csv gam user "~User" print filelist select teamdriveid "~id" fields teamdriveid,id,name,permissions,mimetype
# Common code
# 11: From that list of ACLs, output a CSV file with headers "Owner,teamDriveId,teamDriveName,driveFileId,driveFileTitle,mimeType,permissionId,role,type,emailAddress,domain"
#    that lists the driveFileIds and permissionIds for all ACLs except those from the specified domains.
#    (n.b., teamDriveId, teamDriveName, driveFileTitle, mimeType, role, type, emailAddress and domain are not used in the next step, they are included for documentation purposes)
#  $ python3 GetSharedExternallyTeamDriveACLs.py filelistperms.csv TeamDrives.csv  deleteperms.csv
# 12: Inspect deleteperms.csv, verify that it makes sense and then proceed
# 13: If desired, delete the ACLs
#  $ gam csv ./deleteperms.csv gam user "~Owner" delete drivefileacl "~driveFileId" "~permissionId"
