# Purpose: For a Google Drive User(s), delete all files except those in selected top level folders
# Note: This script can use GAM7 or Advanced GAM:
#       https://github.com/GAM-team/GAM

# Customize: Set PATHS_TO_SAVE
# Python: Use python or python3 below as appropriate to your system; verify that you have version 3
#  $ python -V   or   python3 -V
#  Python 3.x.y
# Usage:
# 1: Get information for all files, if you don't want all users, replace all users with your user selection
#     in the command below, e.g., ou /Students/Classof2019
#    These fields are required: fields id,name,owners.emailaddress
#    You can add additional fields that will be preserved in the output.
#  $ gam config auto_batch_min 1 redirect csv ./UserFiles.csv multiprocess all users print filelist fields id,name,owners.emailaddress fullpath
# 2: From that list of files, output a CSV file with the same headers as the input CSV file
#    that lists the drive file Ids that are not in the selected top level folders
#  $ python3 SelectiveDelete.py ./UserFiles.csv ./DeleteFiles.csv
# 3: Inspect DeleteFiles.csv, verify that it makes sense and then proceed
# 4: Delete the  files
#  $ gam redirect stdout ./DeleteFiles.log multiprocess redirect stderr stdout csv ./DetelteFiles.csv gam user "~owners.0.emailAddress" delete drivefile "~id"
