# Purpose: Get ACLs for Team Drives, expand type group ACls into the constituent type user ACLs. permission.id is deleted for the users as it is not known
# Note: This script can use GAM7 or Advanced GAM:
#       https://github.com/GAM-team/GAM                                                                                                                               
#	https://github.com/taers232c/GAMADV-XTD3
# Customize: Set RETAIN_GROUP_ACL_ROW as desired
# Python: Use python or python3 below as appropriate to your system; verify that you have version 3
#  $ python -V   or   python3 -V
#  Python 3.x.y
# Usage:
# 1: Get ACLs for all Shared Drives
#  $ gam redirect csv ./TeamDriveACLs.csv print teamdriveacls fields id,domain,emailaddress,role,type,deleted oneitemperrow
# 2: Get group members
#  $ gam redirect csv ./GroupMembers.csv print groups roles members,managers,owners delimiter " "
# 3: Generate a CSV file with the same headers as TeamDriveACls.csv with type group ACLs replaced with type user ACLs for each member
#    There is an additional header, permission.group, that shows the group email address from which the user ACLs are derived.
#  $ python3 GetTeamDriveACLsExpandGroups.py TeamDriveACLs.csv GroupMembers.csv TeamDriveACLsExpandedGroups.csv
