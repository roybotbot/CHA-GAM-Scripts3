# Purpose: For a list of group members and a list of users, produce a CSV file that lists the users that are not group members
# Note: This script can use GAM7 or Advanced GAM:

# Python: Use python or python3 below as appropriate to your system; verify that you have version 3
#  $ python -V   or   python3 -V
#  Python 3.x.y
# Usage:
# 1: Get group members
#  $ gam redirect csv ./Members.csv group <GroupName> print
# 2: Get users; replace <UserTypeEntity> as desired, e.g. ou /Teachers
#  $ gam redirect csv ./Users.csv <UserTypeEntity> print
# 3: Make a CSV file NonMembers.csv that lists the users that are not group members
#  $ python3 CheckMembership.py Members.csv Users.csv NonMembers.csv
