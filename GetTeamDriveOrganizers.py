# Purpose: Get organizers for Team Drives
# Note: This script can use GAM7 or Advanced GAM:
#       https://github.com/GAM-team/GAM                                                                                                                               
#	https://github.com/taers232c/GAMADV-XTD3
# Customize: DELIMITER, DOMAIN_LIST, INCLUDE_TYPES, ONE_ORGANIZER, SHOW_NO_ORGANIZER_DRIVES, INCLUDE_FILE_ORGANIZERS
# Python: Use python or python3 below as appropriate to your system; verify that you have version 3
#  $ python -V   or   python3 -V
#  Python 3.x.y
# Usage:
# 1: If you want to include all Team Drives, do this step and then skip to step 4, otherwise start at step 2.
#  $ gam redirect csv ./TeamDrives.csv print teamdrives fields id,name
# 2: If you want Team Drives for a specific set of organizers, replace <UserTypeEntity> with your user selection in the command below
#  $ gam redirect csv ./AllTeamDrives.csv <UserTypeEntity> print teamdrives role organizer fields id,name
# 3: Delete duplicate Team Drives (some may have multiple organizers). Make sure that ID_FIELD = 'id' in DeleteDuplicateRows.py
#  $ python3 DeleteDuplicateRows.py ./AllTeamDrives.csv ./TeamDrives.csv
# 4: Get ACLs for all Team Drives
#  $ gam redirect csv ./TeamDriveACLs.csv multiprocess csv ./TeamDrives.csv gam print drivefileacls "~id" fields id,emailaddress,role,type,deleted
# 5: From that list of ACLs, output a CSV file with headers "id,name,organizers"
#    that shows the organizers for each Team Drive
#  $ python3 GetTeamDriveOrganizers.py TeamDriveACLs.csv TeamDrives.csv TeamDriveOrganizers.csv
