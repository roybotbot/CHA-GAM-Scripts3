"""
# Purpose: Generate adds/deletes/updates from files exported from an SMS
# Note: This script can use GAM7 or Advanced GAM:
#       https://github.com/GAM-team/GAM                                                                                                                               
#	https://github.com/taers232c/GAMADV-XTD3# Usage:
# Customize: Set the field and file names as required/desired
# Python: Use python or python3 below as appropriate to your system; verify that you have version 3
#  $ python -V   or   python3 -V
#  Python 3.x.y
# Methodology:
# A previous export and a current export from the SMS are compared to find changes.
# If a user was not the the previous export and is in the current export, it can be added.
# If a user was in the previous export and is not in the current export, it can be deleted/suspended/ignored.
# If a user is in both exports but some key fields are different, it can be updated.
# If your SMS outputs a unique ID for each user, the script can detect email address changes,
# otherwise an email address change will be processed as an add and a delete/suspend which is probably
# not what you want.
#
# 1: Rename CurrUsers.csv to PrevUsers.csv
# 2: Export current data from SMS to CurrUsers.csv
# 3: Find the changes
#  $ python3 ./FindUserChanges.py
# 4: Do the deletes/suspends; substitute actual field names from SMS CSV file
#  $ gam csv DeleteUsers.csv gam delete user "~EMAIL_FIELD"
#    Rather than delete, you could suspend the users; you can optionally move the uses to a suspended OU
#  $ gam csv DeleteUsers.csv gam update user "~EMAIL_FIELD" suspended true
#  $ gam csv DeleteUsers.csv gam update user "~EMAIL_FIELD" suspended true ou /Suspended
# 5: Do the adds; substitute actual field names from SMS CSV file
#  $ gam csv AddUsers.csv gam create user "~EMAIL_FIELD" firstname "~FIRSTNAME_FIELD" lastname "~LASTNAME_FIELD" password "~PASSWORD_FIELD" ou "~ORGUNIT_FIELD"
# 6: Do the changes; substitute actual field names from SMS CSV file
#    Update users without an email address change
#  $ gam csv UpdateUsers.csv matchfield new-EMAIL_FIELD "" gam update user "~EMAIL_FIELD" firstname "~FIRSTNAME_FIELD" lastname "~LASTNAME_FIELD" password "~PASSWORD_FIELD" ou "~ORGUNIT_FIELD"
#    Update users with an email address change; previous email address is updated to new email address
#  $ gam csv UpdateUsers.csv skipfield new-EMAIL_FIELD "" gam update user "~EMAIL_FIELD" email "new-~~EMAIL_FIELD~~" firstname "~FIRSTNAME_FIELD" lastname "~LASTNAME_FIELD" password "~PASSWORD_FIELD" ou "~ORGUNIT_FIELD"
