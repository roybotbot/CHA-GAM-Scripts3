# Purpose: Show all drive file ACLs for Team Drive files shared with selected groups.
# Note: This script can use GAM7 or Advanced GAM:
#       https://github.com/GAM-team/GAM                                                                                                                               
#	https://github.com/taers232c/GAMADV-XTD3
# Customize: Set GROUP_LIST, DOMAIN_LIST, NON_INHERITED_ACLS_ONLY
# Python: Use python or python3 below as appropriate to your system; verify that you have version 3
#  $ python -V   or   python3 -V
#  Python 3.x.y
# Usage:
# For all Team Drives, start at step 1; For Team Drives selected by user/group/OU, start at step 7
# All Team Drives
# 1: Get all Team Drives.
#  $ gam redirect csv ./TeamDrives.csv print teamdrives fields id,name
# 2: Get ACLs for all Team Drives
#  $ gam redirect csv ./TeamDriveACLs.csv multiprocess csv ./TeamDrives.csv gam print drivefileacls "~id" fields emailaddress,role,type
# 3: Customize GetTeamDriveOrganizers.py for this task:
#    Set DOMAIN_LIST as required
#    Set INCLUDE_TYPES['user'] = True
#    Set INCLUDE_TYPES['group'] = False
#    Set ONE_ORGANIZER = True
# 4: From that list of ACLs, output a CSV file with headers "id,name,organizers"
#    that shows the organizers for each Team Drive
#  $ python3 GetTeamDriveOrganizers.py TeamDriveACLs.csv TeamDrives.csv TeamDriveOrganizers.csv
# 5: Get ACLs for all team drive files
#  $ gam config csv_input_row_filter "organizers:regex:^.+$" redirect csv ./filelistperms.csv multiprocess csv ./TeamDriveOrganizers.csv gam user "~organizers" print filelist select teamdriveid "~id" fields teamdriveid,id,name,permissions,mimetype pm type group em pmfilter
# 6: Go to step 11
# Selected Team Drives
# 7: If you want Team Drives for a specific set of organizers, replace <UserTypeEntity> with your user selection in the command below
#  $ gam redirect csv ./AllTeamDrives.csv <UserTypeEntity> print teamdrives role organizer fields id,name
# 8: Customize DeleteDuplicateRows.py for this task:
#    Set ID_FIELD = 'id'
# 9: Delete duplicate Team Drives (some may have multiple organizers).
#  $ python3 DeleteDuplicateRows.py ./AllTeamDrives.csv ./TeamDrives.csv
# 10: Get ACLs for all team drive files
#  $ gam redirect csv ./filelistperms.csv multiprocess csv ./TeamDrives.csv gam user "~User" print filelist select teamdriveid "~id" fields teamdriveid,id,name,permissions,mimetype pm type group em pmfilter
# Common code
# 11: From that list of ACLs, output a CSV file with headers "Owner,driveFileId,driveFileTitle,mimeType,permissionId,role,emailAddress"
#    that lists the driveFileIds and permissionIds for all ACLs with the desired groups
#    (n.b., driveFileTitle, mimeType, role, and emailAddress are not used in the next step, they are included for documentation purposes)
#  $ python3 GetSharedWithGroupTeamDriveACLs.py filelistperms.csv deleteperms.csv
# 12: Inspect deleteperms.csv, verify that it makes sense and then proceed
# 13: If desired, delete the ACLs
#  $ gam csv ./deleteperms.csv gam user "~Owner" delete drivefileacl "~driveFileId" "~permissionId"
